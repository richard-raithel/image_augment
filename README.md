# image_augment
This repo includes functions to remove green screen backgrounds (still in progress) and add a square watermark to a square images.

To add a watermark:
1. Place your watermark image in the 'watermark' folder
2. Place your original images in the 'input' folder
3. Run the script
4. Results: Your new watermarked images will be in the 'output' folder

Future work will allow this script to work for any shape image and watermark. Didn't need this functionality for my purposes at the moment.
