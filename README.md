# image_augment
This repo includes functions to remove green screen backgrounds (still in progress) and add a square watermark to a square images.

To add a watermark:
1. Create three folders in the main directory: 'input', 'output', 'watermark'
2. Place your watermark image in the 'watermark' folder
3. Place your original images in the 'input' folder
4. Run the script
5. Results: Your new watermarked images will be in the 'output' folder

* Future work will allow this script to work for any shape image and watermark. Don't need this functionality for my purposes at the moment.
